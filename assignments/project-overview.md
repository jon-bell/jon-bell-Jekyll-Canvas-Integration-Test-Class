## Project Overview
The assignments and project for this class are designed to mirror the experiences of a software engineer joining a new development team:
you will be "onboarded" to our codebase, make several individual contributions, and then form a team to propose, develop and implement a new feature.
The codebase that we'll be developing on is a remote collaboration tool called [Covey.Town](https://www.covey.town).
Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life.
Covey.Town is inspired by existing products like [Gather.Town](https://gather.town), [Sococo](https://www.sococo.com), and [Gatherly.IO](https://www.gatherly.io) --- but it is an open source effort, and the features will be proposed and implemented by you!
All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface.





### Overview of Project Deliverables

| Date | Deliverable | Description | 
| -----| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2/12/21 | Team Formation | Specify preferences for teammates |
| 2/26/21 | Project Pitch | Propose a new feature for Covey.Town that can be implemented within 5 weeks |
| 3/12/21 | Project Plan | Refine the scope of your feature based on staff feedback, define detailed requirements and project acceptance criteria. Propose a high-level design. |
| 4/15/21 | Project Implementation and Documentation | Deliver your new feature, including design documentation and tests |

### Team Formation
All projects will be completed in a team of 3-4 students.
The very first deliverable for the project will be a team formation survey: you will be able to indicate
your preferences for teammates. Students may form their own teams (by specifying a complete team of 4 in the survey),
otherwise the instructors will assign students to teams based on responses to the survey.
All students in each team must be in the same section of the class.

### Project Pitch
All projects will involve frontend and backend development of a new feature for Covey.Town.
Once teams have been formed, you and your team will decide what kind of new feature you would like to build.
Your feature should be something that can be implemented within the timeframe allotted (5 weeks), and will be implemented in a fork of the main Covey.Town codebase.
Given that you will be up-to-speed on the Covey.Town codebase (and have been introduced to TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and testing frameworks),
and that you will have a team of four, we expect that the feature that you propose will be more complex than the feature implemented in the individual
homeworks.
